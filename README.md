# STAT 6104 Demos

This repository contains a the demonstrations that I run in-class for STAT 6104 "Computational Statistics".

There are a few things to note:

- If you are a student in this class, do not create your course repo by forking this one
- My demos are primarily for Lectures 1-4. After that, we will switch to board-style lectures
